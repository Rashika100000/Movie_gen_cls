Task Objectives
*The objective of this project is to develop a Machine Learning model that classifies movies into genres based on their textual descriptions. This involves:
*Preprocessing text-based movie plots.
*Feature extraction using techniques like TF-IDF.
*Training different classifiers (Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, etc.).
*Evaluating model performance.
*Providing insights into feature importance and misclassifications.

Code Structure & Guidelines
1-Ensure Clean Code:
  Use meaningful variable & function names.
  Follow PEP 8 coding standards.
  Keep code modular with reusable functions.

2-Write Well-Commented Code:
  Clearly explain preprocessing steps.
  Document model selection and hyperparameters.

3-Follow a Structured File Organization:
  /data/ → Stores datasets.
  /classifiers/ → Contains different ML models.
  /images/ → Stores visualizations.
  /utils.py → Contains helper functions.

Evaluation Criteria

1️⃣ Functionality: Does the model classify genres accurately?
2️⃣ Code Quality: Is the code well-structured and efficient?
3️⃣ Innovation & Creativity: Are there unique features or optimizations?
4️⃣ Documentation: Is the implementation clearly explained?
